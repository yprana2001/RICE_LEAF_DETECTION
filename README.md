# 🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection – Deep Learning Project

This project applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** using TensorFlow and Keras to classify **rice leaf diseases** such as **Brown Spot**, **Leaf Smut**, and **Bacterial Blight**. The model is designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early detection and treatment using image-based diagnosis.

> ✅ The dataset was sourced from publicly available agricultural image repositories and processed locally.
